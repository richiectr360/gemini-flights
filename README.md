## Why was this product built?

Gemini Flight Manager aims to simplify the process of booking flights and searching for travel options. Traditional methods of interacting with airline websites or travel agents can sometimes be cumbersome or time-consuming. Gemini Flight Manager streamlines this process by offering a conversational interface that allows users to interact in natural language, making flight bookings and searches more intuitive and efficient.

Think of this as chatGPT for air travel.

Key features of the Beta version of Gemini Flight Manager include:
- Advanced search capabilities to query flights based on criteria like origin, destination, and dates.
- Booking system that handles seat availability across different classes and calculates costs accordingly.

## How was the product built

Gemini Flight Manager employs state-of-the-art generative AI techniques to understand user queries and generate appropriate responses. The system is trained on a vast dataset of flight-related information, including flight schedules, prices, and booking procedures. When a user interacts with Gemini Flight Manager, the system analyzes their input, extracts relevant information, and performs the necessary actions to fulfill the user's request. This can include searching for available flights, providing information on prices and schedules, and assisting with the booking process.

Features:
- Flight Search: Users can search for flights by providing details such as departure and destination cities, travel dates, and preferred airlines.
- Flight Booking: Users can book flights directly through the chat interface by specifying their travel preferences and completing the booking process.
- Price Comparison: Gemini Flight Manager can compare prices across different airlines and provide recommendations based on the user's budget and preferences.
- Personalized Assistance: The system can offer personalized recommendations and assistance based on the user's past interactions and preferences.
- Real-Time Updates: Gemini Flight Manager provides real-time updates on flight availability, prices, and other relevant information to ensure that users have access to the most up-to-date information.

## Tools to build the product

To build this product, I utilized a combination of Python libraries and frameworks tailored to various functionalities. The backend system was built using FastAPI, designed for managing and simulating flight-related operations. This system provides a robust platform for handling various aspects of flight management, including flight generation, search, and booking functionalities. FastAPI's dependency injection system allowed for efficient handling of HTTP requests, while SQLAlchemy facilitated seamless interaction with the database. Additionally, I integrated tools like requests for making HTTP requests, random for generating random values, and datetime for working with dates and times. For the frontend, I employed Streamlit, a user-friendly framework for building interactive web applications with Python. Furthermore, I leveraged Vertex AI's generative models and tools to enhance the user experience and provide advanced features such as chat sessions within the application. Overall, these tools enabled the creation of a robust and feature-rich flight management system.

To Sum up, the tools used were:
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- Requests
- Random
- Datetime
- Streamlit
- Vertex AI
- Google Cloud
